The files were run in said order of...

1. sakila-data.sql
2. sakila-schema.sql
3. Project 1 - Midterm (Python).ipynb
4. sakila-date-dimension.sql
5. Project 1 - Midterm (MongoDB).ipynb <br>

Note: In Project 1 - Midterm (Python).ipynb, before running line 18, I created a Date Dimension table within the sakila_dw schema to prevent the nonexistent data table error that would have occurred otherwise. <br>

Extra Note: The rest of the files are json files that were used for Project 1 - Midterm (MongoDB).ipynb. Json files were kept in the same folder as the rest of the files in order to maintain simplicity.
